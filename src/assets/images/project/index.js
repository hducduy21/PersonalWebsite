In this project, we simulate an e-wallet with full functions for users such as user identification and confirmation by email (login, log out, forget password,...), functions transactions (money transfer, top-up, withdrawal, card purchase, transaction history,...) and some utility functions (weather forecast,...). In addition, we also have a lot of functions for admin such as user management, transaction management, large transaction confirmation for users, user account verification. \n\nSince we didn't have experience in working and hosting, we didn't use git, so we lost the source code.",
